# inheritance
# Abstraction
# encapsulation
# Polymorphism

## Polymorphism:
  # -- dynamic polymorphism
  # -- static polymorphism
  # byte code
  # operator overloading
  # function overloading

## Encapsulation
  # data members and members function are grouped into a common
  # entity called class

## Abstraction --> cannot be perfomed without Inheritence
   # we define functions and data but does define their working
   # class animal():
       # type = None
       # def breed(self):
       #     pass

## Inheritance -->
 # simple Inheritance
 # multiple inhertiance
 # multilevel inheritance A --> B --> C
 # hybrid Inheritance A --> B --> C
                     # D --> C
